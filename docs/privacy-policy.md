# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: January 27, 2026**

## Overview

Paletteer ("the Add-on") is a Google Sheets add-on that generates and manages color palettes. This privacy policy explains how the Add-on handles your information.

## Data We Access

The Add-on requests the following Google permissions:

- **spreadsheets.currentonly** - Access to the currently open spreadsheet only (not your other files)
- **script.container.ui** - Permission to display the sidebar interface

## Data We Collect

**We do not collect any data.**

- No personal information is collected
- No usage analytics are collected
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- All color generation happens locally within Google's servers

## Data We Store

The Add-on stores only one type of data:

- **Favorite Colors** - When you star a color, it is saved to your Google account using Google's built-in Properties Service. This data is:
  - Stored entirely within your Google account
  - Accessible only to you
  - Never transmitted externally
  - Limited to a maximum of 20 color codes

## Third-Party Services

The Add-on does not use any third-party services, analytics, or external APIs. All functionality runs entirely within Google's infrastructure.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data.

## Data Retention

Your favorite colors remain stored in your Google account until you remove them or uninstall the Add-on.

## Children's Privacy

The Add-on does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the effective date at the top of this page.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect personal data, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete. Your favorite colors can be managed directly within the Add-on by clicking the star icon to remove them.
